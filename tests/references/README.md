# Reference test suite

Chuchich√§stli borrows a lot of code from other projects. We simplify some of the classes and methods to make them easier to understand. This test suite checks that the simplified code behaves the same as the original code.

## Running the tests

You can run the tests with the following command:

```bash
pytest tests/references
```
