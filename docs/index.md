`chuchichaestli` is a collection of model architectures and other
useful bits of code in use at the Centre for Artificial Intelligence's
Intelligent Vision Systems group (CAIIVS) at the University of Applied
Sciences Zurich (ZHAW). We use our models in research of various
topics from medical image artifact removal to astrophysics emulation
of galaxies.


!!!question "Why should I use `chuchichaestli`?"
	
	Many machine learning projects introduce new code. While the code may
	function as intended, it is sometimes developed with a primary focus on
	rapid research publication, which can result in limited documentation and
	reduced ease of reuse.
	This project aims to address these challenges by providing well-structured
	implementations of state-of-the-art architectures and utility tools designed
	for reuse. The codebase of `chuchichaestli` is thoroughly "battle-tested"
	and documented to the best of our ability.
